# Technologies for IoT Laboratories 2022/23

This is the repository used for the laboratories of "Tecnologies for IoT" course
at Politecnico di Torino.

## Repository structure

This repository is structured based on the laboratories of the course.

In the root folder you will find each laboratory part (both hardware and
software) of the course. The files in the folders are divided in a way which
helped us in working on the laboratories.

Moreover, although each exercise has been solved, one can find differences
between the original version required by the exercise and the solution provided
in this current state of the repo: this is because, in some cases, an exercise
of a following laboratory session asked to modify the original version of the
solution.
